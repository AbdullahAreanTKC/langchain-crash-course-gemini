# LangChain Crash Course - Gemini Edition

**Why does this repo exist?**

Many AI APIs like OpenAI require payment, which can be a barrier for learners and open source enthusiasts. This repo solves that by focusing on Gemini, Google's free API, so anyone can run all the code examples without hitting a paywall. Everything here is open source and runnable out of the boxâ€”no credit card required!

Our goal is to provide a fully open source, community-driven resource for:
- Learning how to use LangChain with Gemini step-by-step
- Building your own AI chatbots, RAG systems, and agents
- Sharing and expanding free, practical examples for the community
- Lowering the barrier to entry for AI development

Whether you're a beginner or an experienced developer, this repo is designed to help you get started quickly and contribute back to the ecosystem.

Welcome to the LangChain Crash Course repository! This repo contains all the code examples you'll need to follow along with the LangChain Master Class for Beginners video. By the end of this course, you'll know how to use LangChain to create your own AI agents, build RAG chatbots, and automate tasks with AI.

## Getting Started

### Poetry Installation (Step-by-Step)

Poetry is a tool for dependency management and packaging in Python. Follow these steps to install Poetry on your system:

1. **Install Poetry using the official installer:**

   ```bash
   curl -sSL https://install.python-poetry.org | python3 -
   ```

2. **Add Poetry to your PATH:**
   
   By default, Poetry is installed to `$HOME/.local/bin`. Make sure this directory is in your `PATH`.
   
   Add the following line to your `~/.bashrc`, `~/.zshrc`, or equivalent shell config file:
   
   ```bash
   export PATH="$HOME/.local/bin:$PATH"
   ```
   Then reload your shell:
   ```bash
   source ~/.bashrc  # or source ~/.zshrc
   ```

3. **Verify the installation:**

   ```bash
   poetry --version
   ```
   You should see the installed Poetry version.

- For more details, see the [Poetry installation guide](https://python-poetry.org/docs/#installation).

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.10 or 3.11
- Poetry (Follow this [Poetry installation tutorial](https://python-poetry.org/docs/#installation) to install Poetry on your system)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   <!-- TODO: UPDATE TO MY  -->
   git clone https://github.com/bhancockio/langchain-crash-course
   cd langchain-crash-course
   ```

2. Install dependencies using Poetry:

   ```bash
   poetry install --no-root
   ```

3. Collect your Gemini API key and set up environment variables:

   - Go to the [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey) and sign in with your Google account.
   - Click "Create API Key" and copy your new Gemini API key.
   - Rename the `.env.example` file to `.env` and update the `GEMINI_API_KEY` variable inside with your key. Example:

   ```bash
   mv .env.example .env
   # Then edit .env and set GEMINI_API_KEY=your-key-here
   ```

4. Activate the Poetry shell to run the examples:

   ```bash
   poetry shell
   ```

5. Run the code examples:

   ```bash
    python 1_chat_models/1_chat_model_basic.py
   ```
